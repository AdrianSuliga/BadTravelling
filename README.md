# BadTravelling

Bad travelling is about (somewhat) epic adventure in a dangerous and barbaric land of southern Poland. Set in WÅ‚oszczowa, my game consists of 2 major elements - turn-based combat system and story told via VN-style dialogs.

After entering my game, you are greeted with this Title Screen

Attack allows you to inflict damage on your enemies

Defense creates shield which protects you

Healing heals you by certain fraction of damage you're dealing to your enemy

Game is supposed to have 8 story chapters, as of today - only 7 are complete. There is also no save mechanic, work is still in progress.
